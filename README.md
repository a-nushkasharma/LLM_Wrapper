##  Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- pip(Python Package Manager)
- Virtual Environment tool like venv(Optional)
---
### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-contract-analyzer.git
cd smart-contract-analyzer
```
2. Create virtual environment (optional)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install dependencies
- Requirements are mentioned in requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Add your own openAI API key in llm_api.py
4. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## How It Works
- User uploads a .sol file via the sidebar.
- File is saved locally under uploads/.
- A simulated LLM (placeholder logic for now) analyzes the code.
- Detected issues are presented on-screen in JSON.
- Users can download the report in .json format with one click.
